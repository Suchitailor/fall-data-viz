Carbon Majors is a database of historical production data from 122 of the world’s largest oil, gas, coal, and cement producers. This data is used to quantify the direct operational emissions and emissions from the combustion of marketed products that can be attributed to these entities. The below charts examine emissions from these entities from 2000-2022.

Currently, the Earth is already about 1.2°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s, and emissions continue to rise. To keep global warming to no more than 1.5°C  – as called for in the Paris Agreement – emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. However, it is clear from the graph that emissions from the top producers have not reduced enough to meet that goal. (https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20Earth%20is%20already,reach%20net%20zero%20by%202050.) 

Nation-states and state-owned entities are responsible for a majority of the emissions from top producers over the past 20 years. Their emissions have only trended upwards since 2015. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the top commodity generating CO2 emissions among top producers is coal.

Honing in a bit further at the top 10 producing entities in the past 20 years, China's coal production is by far the leading generator of emissions. It's also noteworthy that 8 out of 10 of these entities are state-owned or a nation-state, further highlighting the need to hold governments responsible for their own emissions. 

Consist with the earlier graph, coal is the top commodity generating CO2 emissions. However, many of the top producers are also generating oil, NGL and natural gas. 

Taking a closer look at their annual emissions, it's clear that China's coal and cement production has consistently generated an outsized share of CO2 emissions for the past 20 years. However, Gazprom quickly entered the scene as a top producer in 2006. 

Removing China's coal production from the visualization, Gazprom's emissions and China's cement emissions become even more apparent. Emissions from the National Iranian Oil Company have also been steadily increasing over the past 20 years.
