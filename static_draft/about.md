# Carbon Emissions Since 2020

Suchi Tailor

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
I want to provide information about what carbon emissions look like among top producers. The goal to inform audiences about carbon emissions is true to my intentions, but the data prompted me to look closer at top producers specifically.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

I am struggling to come up with distinct data visualization types. Some of the chart types I used feel somewhat inorganic/a decision made more to meet the criteria of the assignment. I am looking forward to feedback on my visualization choices. 

I am using mock data for the map chart because I am still sorting out exactly how to execute it. 

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)

I currrently think the best format for the final deliverable is an infographic.
