SUBJECT AREA: I am choosing to do my visualization project on greenhouse gas emissions and the various entities that produce them. Emissions often vary based on type of commodity produced
such as: Oil & NGL, Natural Gas, Anthracite Coal, Bituminous Coal, Lignite Coal, Metallurgical Coal, Sub- Bituminous Coal, Thermal Coal, or Cement. My thought is that it will be helpful
to visualize which entities are producing emissions and how much of the emissions can be contributed to which types of commodities. The organization called Carbon Majors has compiled a 
dataset that tracks emissions from 122 industrial producers on a global scale from 1854-2022. This data and the resulting visualizations can help draw a narrative around how emissions 
have changed over the years, if at all. As described on the database website, this kind of data communication can also help with holding these large organizations and entities responsible
for their contributions to greenhouse gass emissions and climate change. 

DATA SOURCE: https://carbonmajors.org/Downloads - 
This is Carbon Major's database of top industrial greenhouse gas producers. The high granularity datasetbreaks down emissions by entity, commodity, and also operational emissions among
other metrics. The dataset contains 15, 798 rows.
